# National CWS Boundary Update 2
A repository to manage the updating of the EPIC/SimpleLab water service boundaries layer with moderated community contributions.

## How it works

This repository includes state-based `contribution/{state-code}` directories where community members may submit `.geojson` files associated with each inividual contributed boundary. To create a reproducible workflow, the `runner.R` Rscript will 

1. import the first-cut SimpleLab/EPIC boundary layer [published on Hydroshare](http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/6f3386bb4bc945028391cfabf1ea252e)
2. iterate through the `contribution` folders and `.geojson` files, replacing the appropritate polygons in initial boundary layer with the contributions
3. rename variables and adds value-added attributes
4. export the layer to a GeoPackage named `cws.gpkg`
5. Update the layer on Hydroshare


This workflow will be packaged into a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image based on this repository, and exports a finalized `cws.gpkg` to the user's mapped Docker volume. 

## How to contribute

This is a moderated repository. Any user may open a pull request, submitting a `.geojson` file named `{pwsid}.geojson` to the appropriate state `contribution/{state-code}` directory. The file should be formatted as in this [example](https://github.com/cgs-earth/national-cws-boundary-update/blob/main/contribution/MA/MA3035000.geojson), with 6 fields: 

* `pwsid` as {2-letter-state-code}{pwsid number} e.g. `MA3035000`
* `name`, the name of the water system e.g. `Boston Water and Sewer Service Commission`
* `source_url`, a URL detailing the dataset or organization where the information came from, if available
* `contact_email`, the email address for the person providing the file
* `source_date`, the date that the contributed data was last updated
* `contribution_date`, the date that the data was contributed
